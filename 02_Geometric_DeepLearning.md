# Geometric Deep Learning in Engineering Simulations

This section provides resources for **Geometric Deep Learning (GDL)** and its applications in **Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)**. GDL applies deep learning techniques to non-Euclidean domains (such as graphs and manifolds) and is increasingly used to enhance simulation, design optimization, and analysis in engineering.

## ðŸ“Œ Personal Recommendations

    Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) is a core section for handling non-Euclidean CAE data. Michael Bronstein is a pioneer in this field, and his courses, lectures, and publications are essential for anyone wishing to dive deep into GDL. For those interested in practical experimentation, try replicating open-source implementations of models like PointNet or various graph neural networks available on platforms such as Papers with Code. Most implementations will utilize PyTorch Geometric, so familiarity with this library is highly recommended.
