### SSL for Simulation Data in CAE

- **Learning Representations:**  
  Leverage SSL to learn features from unlabelled simulation data.
- **Pre-training for Downstream Tasks:**  
  Use SSL to pre-train models on large simulation datasets before fine-tuning on limited labelled data.
- *Search Google Scholar for* "self-supervised learning simulation data", "SSL pre-training simulation CAE", "self-supervised learning representation simulation", and "SSL feature extraction simulation" for domain-specific studies.


### Example Applications

- **CFD Flow Prediction:**  
  Pre-training models on large CFD simulation datasets to enhance flow prediction accuracy.
- **Mechanical Geometry Analysis:**  
  Learning representations of mechanical part geometries from simulated stress data for defect detection or failure prediction.
- **Contrastive Learning & Masked Autoencoders:**  
  Applying SSL techniques to images, meshes, and time-series simulation data to extract robust features.
