- [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/)


### Textbooks

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction - Sutton & Barto](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf)  


### Example Applications

- **Robotics & Manufacturing Process Optimization:**  
  RL has been applied to optimize control policies in robotic simulations and manufacturing processes.
- **Sequential Decision-Making in Simulations:**  
  Use RL for simulation-based optimization tasks where sequential decisions and environment interactions are key.
- **Predictive Maintenance & Control Optimization:**  
  Explore case studies where RL is used to predict failures and optimize operational parameters in engineering systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Personal Recommendations

- **David Silver's RL Course:**  
  When I started with RL, David Silver's course was my one-stop solutionâ€”his explanations are outstanding.
- **DeepMind/UCL Lecture Videos:**  
  The DeepMind lecture series from UCL offers in-depth insights and complements Silverâ€™s teachings well.
- **Hands-On with OpenAI Gym & Stable Baselines:**  
  Practical experience with OpenAI Gym & Stable Baselines is invaluable for applying RL in real-world scenarios.
- **For a Deep Dive:**  
  I refer to Sutton & Barto's book for advanced topics in reinforcement learning.
