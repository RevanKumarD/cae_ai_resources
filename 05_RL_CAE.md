## ðŸ“Œ Textbooks

* **[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction - Sutton & Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)**: The "bible" of RL, and a free online version is available.

## ðŸ“Œ Research Papers

* **Reinforcement Learning for Structural Optimization**: Discusses the application of reinforcement learning algorithms in optimizing structural designs within CAE.
* **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)**: DDPG is often used in continuous control problems relevant to CAE.

## ðŸ“Œ RL for CAE Optimization

* **Optimization of simulation parameters, control problems in CAE, design optimization using RL**.
* Papers on using RL for optimizing controllers in simulations (e.g., fluid flow control, robotic simulations) can be found by searching **"reinforcement learning simulation control", "RL fluid flow control", "RL robotics simulation"**.
* RL for design parameter optimization in CAE models can be explored via **"reinforcement learning design optimization CAE", "RL parameter optimization simulation"**.

## ðŸ“Œ Example Applications

* RL in robotics, manufacturing process optimization, and sequential decision-making in simulations.
* Consider problems where sequential decision-making and interaction with a simulation environment are key.
* Specific RL application papers will depend heavily on the CAE optimization task â€“ search based on your application.
