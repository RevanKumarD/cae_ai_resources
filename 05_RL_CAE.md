### RL for CAE Optimization

- **Optimization of Simulation Parameters & Control Problems:**  
  Search for studies using terms like "reinforcement learning simulation control", "RL fluid flow control", and "RL robotics simulation".
- **Design Optimization in CAE Models:**  
  Look up "reinforcement learning design optimization CAE" or "RL parameter optimization simulation" for domain-specific applications.

### Example Applications

- **Robotics & Manufacturing Process Optimization:**  
  RL has been applied to optimize control policies in robotic simulations and manufacturing processes.
- **Sequential Decision-Making in Simulations:**  
  Use RL for simulation-based optimization tasks where sequential decisions and environment interactions are key.
- **Predictive Maintenance & Control Optimization:**  
  Explore case studies where RL is used to predict failures and optimize operational parameters in engineering systems.

### Personal Recommendations

- **David Silver's RL Course:**  
  When I started with RL, David Silver's course was my one-stop solution—his explanations are outstanding.
- **DeepMind/UCL Lecture Videos:**  
  The DeepMind lecture series from UCL offers in-depth insights and complements Silver’s teachings well.
- **Hands-On with OpenAI Gym:**  
  Practical experience with OpenAI Gym is invaluable for applying RL in real-world scenarios.
- **For a Deep Dive:**  
  I refer to Brutto's book for advanced topics in reinforcement learning.
