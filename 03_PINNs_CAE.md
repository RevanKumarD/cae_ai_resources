# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for CAE Workflows

This section provides a detailed overview of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their applications in Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE). PINNs integrate physical laws directly into neural network training to solve complex partial differential equations (PDEs) for both forward and inverse problems, ensuring that models adhere to known physical constraints.
