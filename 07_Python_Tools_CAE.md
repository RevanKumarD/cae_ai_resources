# Python Programming Tools for CAE

This document provides resources on **Python Programming Tools and Libraries for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) integration**.

## ðŸ“Œ Core Libraries

* **NumPy**: For numerical computation, arrays, and linear algebra.
* **SciPy**: For scientific and technical computing, optimisation and integration.
* **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation, particularly with DataFrames.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualisation libraries.
* **Scikit-learn**: Classical Machine Learning algorithms, preprocessing and model evaluation.
* **TensorFlow**: Deep Learning framework (Google).
* **PyTorch**: Deep Learning framework (Facebook).
* **Keras**: Used for developing and deploying machine learning models in engineering applications.

## ðŸ“Œ CAE-Specific Libraries & Tools

* **pyMOR (Python for Model Order Reduction)**: For reduced order modelling and surrogate modelling in simulations.
* **FEniCS/Firedrake**: Finite Element Method solvers that can be integrated with ML.
* **OpenFOAM**: Open-source CFD solver; Python can be used for pre/post-processing and control.
* **Abaqus Scripting (Python API)**: Python API for Abaqus CAE (commercial software).
* **ANSYS PyAnsys Libraries**: Python libraries for interacting with ANSYS products (commercial software).
* **Gmsh (Python API)**: Mesh generation tool with Python API.
* **Meshio**: I/O for various mesh formats in Python.
* **VTK (Visualization Toolkit, Python bindings)**: For visualisation of simulation results.
* **Paraview (Python scripting)**: Powerful visualisation tool with Python scripting capabilities.
* **pyNastran**: Interface to Nastran file formats.
* **pythonocc**: 3D CAD/CAE/PLM development framework for Python.
* **CadQuery**: Python library for CAD modelling.
* **Anvil**: Open-source tool integrating FreeCAD for CAD modelling and OpenFOAM for CFD analysis, along with AI-based optimisation methods, facilitating CAE integration.

## ðŸ“Œ Geometric Deep Learning Libraries

* **PyTorch Geometric**: A Python library for implementing Graph Neural Networks and GDL models.
* **Deep Graph Library (DGL)**: Another popular Python library for GNNs and GDL.

## ðŸ“Œ Physics-Informed Neural Network Libraries

* **DeepXDE**: Python library focused on PINNs, supports TensorFlow and PyTorch.
* **SciANN**: Python library for scientific machine learning, includes PINNs.

## ðŸ“Œ Best Practices

* **Modular code design**: Break down complex CAE+AI workflows into reusable Python modules.
* Use virtual environments (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) to manage dependencies and project isolation.
* Document your code using docstrings, comments, and READMEs to explain Python CAE integrations.
* Use version control (Git) to track changes to Python scripts and CAE workflows.
* Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of Python CAE code.
* Optimise performance by profiling Python code for speed when working with large CAE datasets or computationally intensive tasks. Consider libraries like Numba or Cython if needed.
